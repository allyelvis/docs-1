Squid is shipped with an easy-to-use [command-line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface). 

See [usage](/cli/usage) for more information about how to use the CLI.

## Installing

In some cases, it won't be installed by default because we need admin permissions.

You may be asked your user's password to complete the installation.

## Uninstalling
You can uninstall the CLI by going into the appliction's menu and selecting `Uninstall CLI`.
You may be asked your user's password to complete the uninstallation.

## Updating
The CLI automatically update itself when new version of Squid are installed.
You can also force to update the CLI by going into the appliction's menu and selecting `Update CLI`.
